Description: In a typical experiment for the intuitive judgment of frequencies (JoF) different stimuli with different frequencies are presented. The participants consider these stimuli with a constant duration and give a judgment of frequency. These judgments can be simulated by formal models: PASS 1 and PASS 2 based on Sedlmeier (2002, ISBN:978-0198508632), MINERVA 2 baesd on Hintzman (1984) <doi:10.3758/BF03202365> and TODAM 2 based on Murdock, Smith & Bai (2001) <doi:10.1006/jmps.2000.1339>. The package provides an assessment of the frequency by determining the core aspects of these four models (attention, decay, and presented frequency) that can be compared to empirical results.
