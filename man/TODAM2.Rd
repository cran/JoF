\usage{
TODAM2(x, y, ..., sqc, gamma = 1, alpha = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{input handled by TODAM 2. Normal distributed inputs
with mean = 0 and sd = 1 / n are allowed. This representation
enables discrimination and similarity between different items.
See vignette for details.}

\item{y}{another input handled by TODAM 2. At least two
inputs are needed for the simulation.}

\item{...}{other inputs handled by TODAM 2.}

\item{sqc}{sequence of the different objects. Each input gets
an ascending number. \code{x} gets the value \code{1},
\code{y} gets the value \code{2}, \code{...} gets the value
\code{3} and so on.
The argument \code{sqc = c(1, 2, 3, 2)} means: first
input \code{x} is processed, second input \code{y} is
processed followed by processing input number three and
fourth, th input \code{y} is used again.
So \code{sqc} contains the frequency information too.
In \code{c(1, 2, 3, 2)}, \code{x} and  the third input
are presented once. The input \code{y} is presented twice.}

\item{gamma}{is the atttention- or learningparameter. Values
between 0 and 1 are allowed. 1 represents perfect learning.
If \code{gamma} iis a vector, each input
could be handled differently. So \code{gamma = c(.5, .6, 1)}
means, the third input is stored correctly and betther than
the \code{y} better than first input \code{x}).}

\item{alpha}{represents the decay. If \code{alpha = 1},
the complete memory vector is used (and no forgetting takes
place). If \code{alpha} is an numeric Vector e. g.
\code{alpha = c(.8, .9, 1)}, the memory vector is weighted.
The memory for the first input is weaker than the second
than the third.}

Modeling Judgments of Frequency with TODAM 2

\details{
In the original publication TODAM 2 is more complex
 and has more parameters. Especially the design for the input
 is a concatenation between item and context. The normal
 distributed input has a \emph{mean = 0} and \emph{sd = 1/n}.
 A pragmatic solution to make the models input comparable is
 to use a binary input like in PASS. There is no explicit argument
 for noise.

Convolution:
\deqn{ F_{i}^{2}  = \sum_{i=1} f_{i} * f_{m-i+1} and m = 2n - 1}
Memory:
\deqn{M_{t} = \alpha M_{t-1} + \gamma F_{t}^{2} }
Correlation
\deqn{R_{m} = \sum_{(i;j)\in S(m)} F_{t}^{2} there
S(m)(i;j)| -(n-1)/2 \le i,j \le (n-1)/2 and i-j = m }
}
\examples{
o1 <- c(-0.27, -0.24, -0.24, 0.75)
o2 <- c(-0.06, -0.55,  0.66, -0.06)
o3 <- c(0.04,  0.57, -0.65,  0.04)
o4 <- c(0.73, -0.39, -0.20, -0.14)
TODAM2(o1, o2, o3, o4, gamma = rep(c(0.7, 0.8), 5),
alpha = 0.95, sqc = rep(1:4, 4:1))
